# [DubHacks2020] Think Twice

## ðŸ“„ What is it?

Think Twice is a simple-to-use, simple-to-install chrome extension that helps you think twice before making a hasty purchase online. 

## ðŸ§­ How does it work?

Think Twice monitors the browser you're on while using Chrome and recognizes when you add an item to a cart or attempt to purchase it directly. It then triggers a prompt for you to explain why you are purchasing that item - giving you an opportunity to rethink your purchase decision seamlessly. Our focus for Think Twice is its simplicity - from the installation process to intervention.

You can then see a log of all your purchasing history and reasoning through the built-in dashboard by clicking the extension symbol on the browser tab.

Currently, Think Twice is only supported for shopping experience on amazon.com.
